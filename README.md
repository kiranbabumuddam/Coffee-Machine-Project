# Coffee-Machine-Project

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Practice working with classes, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Java.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn

### Stage 1:
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

### Stage 2:
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

### Stage 3:
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

### Stage 4:
Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

### Stage 5:
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

### Stage 6:
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
